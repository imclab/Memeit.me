Memeit.me is a twitter meme generator originally developed for Photohack Day 2 in NYC on 02/26/2012


It provides the following:

(1) Twitter stream integration
(2) Searches flickr for images that may be related to the incoming tweets
(3) A meme generation web service
(4) A plugable worker architecture that allows for additional post processing
of tweets so that one can easily add other image services and text translators

Requires: imagemagick, cairo, a redis server and a mongo server.
Modified Knox S3 client that supports writing a PNG stream. Its in lib and shouldn't be.
